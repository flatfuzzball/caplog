# captain's log
## minimal, no dependency gemlog generator.

simply download the python file and configure the variables to your liking.
to post, simply create a gmi file in your current directory, type away, and run the program. it generates an index.gmi file where all non-ignored gmi files are listed with dates.
it does not generate atom/rss feeds.
