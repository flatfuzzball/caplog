# captain's log
## minimal, no dependency gemlog generator in 18 lines of python (excluding comments and empty lines).

simply download the python file and configure the variables to your liking.

to post, simply create a gmi file in your current directory, type away, and run the program. it generates an index.gmi file where all non-ignored gmi files are listed with dates.

optionally uses gemfeed to generate atom feeds.
